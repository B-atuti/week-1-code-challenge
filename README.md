# JavaScript Coding Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to three JavaScript coding challenges: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

The Student Grade Generator is a program that prompts the user to input student marks and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following scale:

- A: greater than 79
- B: 60 to 79
- C: 59 to 49
- D: 40 to 49
- E: less than 40

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

The Speed Detector program takes as input the speed of a car and determines if the driver is over the speed limit. If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit, it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

The Net Salary Calculator program calculates an individual's net salary by taking inputs for the basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary based on specific rules and calculations.

## Usage

Each challenge is implemented as a separate JavaScript file. You can run the code in your preferred JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or Node.js.
